# Fluid - Project     
      
## Description      
The objective of this project is to simulate the fluid behavior in a water tower by modeling and simulating it.     
Using Bernoulli and Torricelli theorem.   
     
We study the effects of fluid properties on its behavior.    

## Part 1      
  
This part concerns the stationary flow of perfect incompressible fluids and consists of better understanding Torricelli’s theorem via the emptying of a static tank.

## Part 2  
  
This part aims to simulate the flow of real fluids by applying the approach Lagrangian from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).
